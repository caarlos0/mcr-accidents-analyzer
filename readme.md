# accidents

So, my city has - I think - a problem with too many accidents on roundabouts.
At least, that's my theory.

This scrapes our local news site for accidents for as long as it can, and then
uses AI to try to categorize each, put them in a database, so I can extract
information from it to see whether my hunch is correct or not.

If it is, I'll probably deliver this information to city hall and the local news
outlets.
