# mcr-accidents-analyzer

So, the city (marechal candido rondon) I live has - I think - a problem with too
many accidents on roundabouts. At least, that's my theory.

This scrapes our local news site for accidents for as long as it can, and then
uses AI to try to categorize each, put them in a database, so I can extract
information from it to see whether my hunch is correct or not.

The python code was written by claude and i just made some minor modifications.

PS: this is obviously not 100% accurate.
